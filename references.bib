  abstract      = {{Non-biological experimental variation or “batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes (\\&gt;25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice. Software for our method is freely available at: http://biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/batch/.}},

  abstract     = {The acquisition of cancer hallmarks requires molecular alterations at multiple levels including genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome. In the past decade, numerous attempts have been made to untangle the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis involving single OMICS approaches such as scanning the genome for cancer-specific mutations and identifying altered epigenetic-landscapes within cancer cells or by exploring the differential expression of mRNA and protein through transcriptomics and proteomics techniques, respectively. While these single-level OMICS approaches have contributed towards the identification of cancer-specific mutations, epigenetic alterations, and molecular subtyping of tumors based on gene/protein-expression, they lack the resolving-power to establish the casual relationship between molecular signatures and the phenotypic manifestation of cancer hallmarks. In contrast, the multi-OMICS approaches involving the interrogation of the cancer cells/tissues in multiple dimensions have the potential to uncover the intricate molecular mechanism underlying different phenotypic manifestations of cancer hallmarks such as metastasis and angiogenesis. Moreover, multi-OMICS approaches can be used to dissect the cellular response to chemo- or immunotherapy as well as discover molecular candidates with diagnostic/prognostic value. In this review, we focused on the applications of different multi-OMICS approaches in the field of cancer research and discussed how these approaches are shaping the field of personalized oncomedicine. We have highlighted pioneering studies from "The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)" consortium encompassing integrated OMICS analysis of over 11,000 tumors from 33 most prevalent forms of cancer. Accumulation of huge cancer-specific multi-OMICS data in repositories like TCGA provides a unique opportunity for the systems biology approach to tackle the complexity of cancer cells through the unification of experimental data and computational/mathematical models. In future, systems biology based approach is likely to predict the phenotypic changes of cancer cells upon chemo-/immunotherapy treatment. This review is sought to encourage investigators to bring these different approaches together for interrogating cancer at molecular, cellular, and systems levels.},

  abstract     = {Abstract The major transcript variants of human protein-coding genes are annotated to a certain degree of accuracy combining manual curation, transcript data, and proteomics evidence. However, there is considerable disagreement on the annotation of about 2000 genes—they can be protein-coding, noncoding, or pseudogenes—and on the annotation of most of the predicted alternative transcripts. Pure transcriptome mapping approaches seem to be limited in discriminating functional expression from noise. These limitations have partially been overcome by dedicated algorithms to detect alternative spliced micro-exons and wobble splice variants. Recently, knowledge about splice mechanism and protein structure are incorporated into an algorithm to predict neighboring homologous exons, often spliced in a mutually exclusive manner. Predicted exons are evaluated by transcript data, structural compatibility, and evolutionary conservation, revealing hundreds of novel coding exons and splice mechanism re-assignments. The emerging human pan-genome is necessitating distinctive annotations incorporating differences between individuals and between populations.},

abstract = "Summary
A key challenge in cancer control and prevention is detection of the disease as early as possible, enabling effective interventions and therapies to contribute to reduction in mortality and morbidity. Biomarkers are important as molecular signposts of the physiological state of a cell at a specific time. Active genes, their respective protein products, and other organic chemicals made by the cell create these signposts. As a normal cell progresses through the complex process of transformation to a cancerous state, biomarkers could prove vital for the identification of early cancer and people at risk of developing cancer. We discuss current research into the genetic and molecular signatures of cells, including microsatellite instability, hypermethylation and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The use of genomic and proteomic high-throughput technology platforms to facilitate detection of early cancer by means of biomarkers, and issues on the analysis, validation, and predictive value of biomarkers based on these technologies are also discussed. We report on recent advances in identifying sources of biomarkers that can be accessed by noninvasive techniques, such as buccal-cell isolates, as well as traditional sources such as serum or plasma. We also focus on the work of the Early Detection Research Network at the National Cancer Institute, harnessing expertise from leading national and international institutions, to identify and validate biomarkers for the detection of precancerous and cancerous cells in assessing risk of cancer. The network also has a role in linking discovery to process development, resulting in early detection tests and clinical assessment."

Some of the ramifications and effects that preprocessing methods have on the statistical results are illustrated. The discussions are centered around a microarray experiment based on lung cancer tumor samples with survival as the clinical outcome of interest. The procedures that are presented focus on the array platform used in this study. However, many of these issues are more general and are applicable to other instruments for genome-wide investigation. The discussions here will provide insight into the statistical challenges in preprocessing microarrays used in clinical studies of cancer.

But despite substantial epidemiologic data showing that a large proportion of cancers and cancer deaths are preventable, decreases in cancer mortality rates in developed countries have lagged far behind decreases in mortality rates from heart disease (1), another major disease amenable to prevention (for example, 18 versus 68\% decrease, respectively, between 1969 and 2013 in the United States) (2). We believe that one main factor explaining the relatively modest reduction in mortality is the limited support for cancer prevention research, which receives only 2 to 9\% of global cancer research funding (3). As a United Nations (UN) High-Level Meeting begins this week to review efforts to combat noncommunicable diseases, a key question is how to prioritize resources to realize the potential of cancer prevention.},

  abstract      = {The widely used k top scoring pair (k-TSP) algorithm is a simple yet powerful parameter-free classifier. It owes its success in many cancer microarray datasets to an effective feature selection algorithm that is based on relative expression ordering of gene pairs. However, its general robustness does not extend to some difficult datasets, such as those involving cancer outcome prediction, which may be due to the relatively simple voting scheme used by the classifier. We believe that the performance can be enhanced by separating its effective feature selection component and combining it with a powerful classifier such as the support vector machine (SVM). More generally the top scoring pairs generated by the k-TSP ranking algorithm can be used as a dimensionally reduced subspace for other machine learning classifiers.},

  abstract = {{In 2000, the NCI (Rockville, MD) established the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) to identify, develop, and validate biomarkers to improve the detection of early-stage cancers and risk assessment. This consortium of more than 300 investigators at academic institutions and in the private sector is working collaboratively to bring biomarkers and imaging methods to clinical fruition. Although significant roadblocks have hindered the field of biomarker discovery and validation, the EDRN has helped overcome many of them by setting well-defined strategies and milestones focused on solving defined unmet clinical needs. The EDRN has implemented measures to improve biomarker discovery and validation, such as data sharing, use of common data elements, generating multidisciplinary and multi-institutional collaborations within a cohesive and productive team environment, and putting emphasis on quality control and data replication for all candidate biomarkers for reaching a “go” or “no go” decision. A measure of the success of the EDRN is the number of biomarkers tests or devices approved by the FDA to which EDRN investigators have made significant contributions and the number of biomarkers tests developed by EDRN investigators that are available in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments laboratories.See all articles in this CEBP Focus section, “NCI Early Detection Research Network: Making Cancer Detection Possible.”}},

The measurement of transcriptome-wide gene expression has convincingly switched from microarrays to sequencing in a matter of years. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides a quantitative and open system for profiling transcriptional outcomes on a large scale and therefore facilitates a large diversity of applications, including basic science studies, but also agricultural or clinical situations. In the past 10 years or so, much has been learned about the characteristics of the RNA-seq data sets, as well as the performance of the myriad of methods developed. In this review, we give an overview of the developments in RNA-seq data analysis, including experimental design, with an explicit focus on the quantification of gene expression and statistical approachesfor differential expression. We also highlight emerging data types, such as single-cell RNA-seq and gene expression profiling using long-read technologies.},

Discussions of basic concepts like time axis, event definition and censoring are given. Hazard models are introduced, with special emphasis on the Cox proportional hazards regression model. We provide check lists that may be useful both when fitting the model and assessing its goodness of fit and when interpreting the results. Special attention is paid to how to avoid problems with immortal time bias by introducing time-dependent covariates. We discuss prediction based on hazard models and difficulties when attempting to draw proper causal conclusions from such models. Finally, we present a series of examples where the methods and check lists are exemplified. Computational details and implementation using the freely available R software are documented in Supplementary Material. The paper was prepared as part of the STRATOS initiative.},

However, the IPD used to generate published survival curves are not generally publicly available. We impute survival IPD from ~500 arms of Phase 3 oncology trials (representing ~220,000 events) and find that they are well fit by a two-parameter Weibull distribution. Use of Weibull functions with overall survival significantly increases the precision of small arms typical of early phase trials: analysis of a 50-patient trial arm using parametric forms is as precise as traditional, non-parametric analysis of a 90-patient arm. We also show that frequent deviations from the Cox proportional hazards assumption, particularly in trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors, arise from time-dependent therapeutic effects. Trial duration therefore has an underappreciated impact on the likelihood of success.},

  abstract      = {In modern high-throughput data analysis, researchers perform a large number of statistical tests, expecting to find perhaps a small fraction of significant effects against a predominantly null background. Higher Criticism (HC) was introduced to determine whether there are any nonzero effects; more recently, it was applied to feature selection, where it provides a method for selecting useful predictive features from a large body of potentially useful features, among which only a rare few will prove truly useful. In this article, we review the basics of HC in both the testing and feature selection settings. HC is a flexible idea, which adapts easily to new situations; we point out simple adaptions to clique detection and bivariate outlier detection. HC, although still early in its development, is seeing increasing interest from practitioners; we illustrate this with worked examples. HC is computationally effective, which gives it a nice leverage in the increasingly more relevant "Big Data" settings we see today. We also review the underlying theoretical "ideology" behind HC. The Rare/Weak (RW) model is a theoretical framework simultaneously controlling the size and prevalence of useful/significant items among the useless/null bulk. The RW model shows that HC has important advantages over better known procedures such as False Discovery Rate (FDR) control and Family-wise Error control (FwER), in particular, certain optimality properties. We discuss the rare/weak phase diagram, a way to visualize clearly the class of RW settings where the true signals are so rare or so weak that detection and feature selection are simply impossible, and a way to understand the known optimality properties of HC.

  abstract     = {{Background Regression to the mean (RTM) is a statistical phenomenon that can make natural variation in repeated data look like real change. It happens when unusually large or small measurements tend to be followed by measurements that are closer to the mean.Methods We give some examples of the phenomenon, and discuss methods to overcome it at the design and analysis stages of a study.Results The effect of RTM in a sample becomes more noticeable with increasing measurement error and when follow-up measurements are only examined on a sub-sample selected using a baseline value.Conclusions RTM is a ubiquitous phenomenon in repeated data and should always be considered as a possible cause of an observed change. Its effect can be alleviated through better study design and use of suitable statistical methods.}},
