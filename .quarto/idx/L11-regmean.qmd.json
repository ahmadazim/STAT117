The goal is to motivate methods, like multilevel models, that can help you anticipate and predict the effects of regression to the mean on the practical performance of biomarkers selected through a discovery process.\n\n### Data\n\nContinuous genomic feature: gene expression microarray readout in the TCGA study\n\nBinary phenotype (optimal surgical debulking)\n\n```{r, cache = T, message=F}\nlibrary(curatedOvarianData)\nlibrary(ROCR)\ndata(TCGA_eset)\nXX = as.matrix(cbind(exprs(TCGA_eset)))\nYY = 1 * as.vector(pData(TCGA_eset)[,\"debulking\"]==\"optimal\")\nXX = XX[,!is.na(YY)]; \nYY = YY[!is.na(YY)]\n\nXXX = XX\nYYY = YY\n# subset\nsubs = 1:100\nXX = XX[,subs]; YY = YY[subs]\n\n```\n\nAs before, we create two sets of summary scores. `ScoresSub` yields the four metrics computed on the first 100 patients, while `ScoresAll` gives the four metrics computed on the entire set of patients.\n\n```{r, cache=TRUE}\nsource(\"RScripts/Scores.R\")\nScoresSub = CompScores(XX,YY)\nScoresAll = CompScores(XXX,YYY)\n```\n\nWe also recreate the permutation distribution of the scores.\n\n```{r, cache=TRUE}\nset.seed(1)\nYYNull = YY[ sample(1:length(YY)) ]\nScoresSubNull = CompScores(XX,YYNull)\n\nset.seed(1)\nYYYNull = YYY[ sample(1:length(YYY)) ]\nScoresAllNull = CompScores(XXX,YYYNull)\n```\n\n### Motivation\n\nBefore looking at regression to the mean, let's first consider some simple exploration of the TCGA data. I picked a cutoff on the AUC and applied it to both the subsample and the full sample. Then I cross-tabulated discoveries. I did that with both the real data and the data after permutation of the obtimal debulking label.\n\n```{r}\nacut = .59\naucDiscSub = ScoresSub[,\"AUC\"]>acut\naucDiscSubNull= ScoresSubNull[,\"AUC\"]>acut\naucDiscAll = ScoresAll[,\"AUC\"]>acut\naucDiscAllNull = ScoresAllNull[,\"AUC\"]>acut\ntable(aucDiscSub,aucDiscAll)\n```\n\n```{r}\ntable(aucDiscSubNull)\ntable(aucDiscAllNull)\n```\n\n::: callout-note\nWhat can we learn from the null distribution?\n:::\n\n\\newpage\n\n## Simulated Example\n\nSimulated example of the regression to the mean phenomenon. Here for simplicity I bypass the two group setting and just model a single group. The lessons in this example translate almost directly to making inferences on fold change. Fold change is defined over two groups. The analogy is between the means in this simulation and the *mean difference* in the two group case. The caveat is that the sample size does translate directly from one scenario to the other (the TCGA data are not paired), but the general behavior of the estimates as sample size(s) increase remains the same.\n\n```{r}\nN1 = 10\nN2 = 100\nNG = 50\n\nset.seed(127)\nTrueNoise = rexp(NG,1/5)\nset.seed(123)\nTrueMeans = rnorm(NG,0,1)\nset.seed(124)\nMeans1 = rnorm(NG,TrueMeans,TrueNoise*sqrt(1/N1))\nset.seed(125)\nMeans2 = ( N1*Means1 + (N2-N1) * \n             rnorm(NG,TrueMeans,TrueNoise*sqrt(1/(N2-N1))) ) / N2\n```\n\nIn this simulation, I introduce two sources of variation: variation in the gene-level parametrs (TrueMeans and TrueNoise) and sampling variation. As you go through the results try to tease out the roles of these two sources of variation. Figuring it out on your own is the best strategy.
