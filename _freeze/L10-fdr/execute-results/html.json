How can we assess the quality of the discovery process and results? The most basic version of this assessment is based on assuming there is a binary truth at the gene level, representing biomarker with and without biological signal, and that the discovery process is about revealing this vector of binary labels. Formally, this is a multiple hypothesis testing problem.\n\nThe literature of multiple testing is enormously big. A favorite of mine is [\\@Tukey:1991ga](https://doi.org/10.1214/ss/1177011945)\n\n### Setting and notation:\n\n$g = 1, \\ldots, G$ genomic features, for example genes in gene-level analysis of expression data\n\n$i = 1, \\ldots, I$ subjects in the discovery sample\n\n$x_{1g}, \\ldots, x_{Ig}$ observed quantitative level of the expression of gene $g$ in the $I$ subjects\n\n$y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{I}$ binary class labels for the $I$ subjects\n\n$z_g = z_g (x_{1g}, \\ldots, x_{Ig}, y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{I})$ a statistic used to select, or \"discover\" biomarkers. For example the absolute value of a t-statistic, the AUC or the fold change. We assume that larger values of the statistic are indicative of the signal we try to discover.\n\n$H_{0g}$ is the event that for gene $g$ there is no signal, that is if the two classes have identical distributions for the expression $x$.\n\n$p_g = P ( z_g > c | H_{0g})$ p-value.\n\n\\newpage\n\n### Data\n\nContinuous genomic feature: gene expression microarray readout in the TCGA study\n\nBinary phenotype (optimal surgical debulking)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(curatedOvarianData)\nlibrary(ROCR)\ndata(TCGA_eset)\nXX = as.matrix(cbind(exprs(TCGA_eset)))\nYY = 1 * as.vector(pData(TCGA_eset)[,\"debulking\"]==\"optimal\")\nXX = XX[,!is.na(YY)]; \nYY = YY[!is.na(YY)]\n\nXXX = XX\nYYY = YY\n# subset\nsubs = 1:100\nXX = XX[,subs]; YY = YY[subs]\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Distribution of p-values\n\nWe next create two sets of summary scores. `ScoresSub` yields the four metrics computed on the first 100 patients, while `ScoresAll` gives the four metrics computed on the entire set of patients.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsource(\"RScripts/Scores.R\")\nScoresSub = CompScores(XX,YY)\nScoresAll = CompScores(XXX,YYY)\n```\n:::\n\n\nA useful place to start a discussion about multiple testing are the histograms of the p-values obtained with the t-test.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2), pty = \"s\")\nhist(exp(-ScoresSub[,\"nlpvalueT\"]),\n     main=\"Subset\",xlab=\"p-value\")\nhist(exp(-ScoresAll[,\"nlpvalueT\"]),\n     main=\"Full Set\",xlab=\"p-value\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Histograms of P-values, for the 100 patient subset (left) and Entire Set](L10-fdr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2), pty = \"s\")\nplot(ecdf(exp(-ScoresSub[,\"nlpvalueT\"])),\n     main=\"Subset\",xlab=\"p-value\",ylab=\"Empirical CDF\"); abline(0,1)\nplot(ecdf(exp(-ScoresAll[,\"nlpvalueT\"])),\n     main=\"Full Set\",xlab=\"p-value\",ylab=\"Empirical CDF\" ); abline(0,1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Empirical CDFs of P-values, for the 100 patient subset (left) and Entire Set ](L10-fdr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n### Higher Criticism\n\nReview: if the null hypothesis is correct, the sampling distribution of the p-value is uniform in (0,1). \"Sampling distribution\" refers to hypothetical repetitions of the same experiment, in this case under the null.\n\n-   These histograms show a single experiment. The distribution arises from variation across biomarkers. Can we still learn something useful about the frequentist multiple testing problem?\n\n-   How would you test for the \"global null\", that is the scenario where each and every biomarker is independent of the debulking status?\n:::\n\nHint: [\\@Donoho2015ss](http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.ss/1425492437)\n\n\\newpage\n\n## False Discovery Rates\n\nA simple way to think about the discovery process is to focus on a list of promising candidates (or \"discoveries\"), as we did in our previous lecture. If we know the true data generating model for each gene, we could, for example, look at this table:\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{center}\n\\resizebox{\\linewidth}{!}{% Resize table to fit within \\linewidth horizontally\n\\begin{tabular}{|lccc|}\n\\hline\n& No Discovery & Discovery & Total \\\\\n\\hline\nNull hypotheses & $U$ & $R_0$ & $G_0$ \\\\\nAlternative hypotheses & $T$ & $R_A$ & $G - G_0$ \\\\\n\\hline\nTotal & $G-R$ & $R$ & $G$ \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\end{center}\n```\n\nIt is common to study the proportion $R_0/R$ of discoveries for which the true data generating model is null.\n\n::: callout-note\n$R_0/R$ is unknown. It depends on both the data and the parameter (the vector of indicators of whether eagh gene is null)\n\n-   When is $R_0/R$ an appropriate quantity to focus on?\n:::\n\nThis parameter can be estimated from a couple of different perspectives. If you are interested in evaluating the list generating *process* you may be interested in a frequentist expectation. Bounds can be obtained using methods like Benjamini-Hochberg (see below). If your focus is on the actual list rather than the procedure, Bayesian estimates may be your choice.\n\nWe review many of the connections here: [\\@muel:parm:rice:2007](https://biostats.bepress.com/jhubiostat/paper115/)\n\n\\newpage\n\n### Frequentist Definition of FDR\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{itemize} \n\\item Define the \\textcolor{red}{\\textbf{False Discovery Proportion}} (FDP) as:\n\\begin{equation*}\n    FDP=\n    \\begin{cases}\n      R_0/R, & \\text{if}\\ R >0 \\\\\n      0, & \\text{if}\\ R = 0\n    \\end{cases}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\item Then the frequentist \\textcolor{blue}{\\textbf{False Discovery Rate}} (FDR) is:\n$$\nFDR = \\mathbb{E_x}(FDP)\n$$\nwhere the expectation is with respect to the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n```\n\n\\newpage\n\n### The Benjamini-Hochberg Algorithm\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \nThe Benjamini-Hochberg Method can be used to construct a list of discoveries from the p-values, controlling the False Discovery Rate via bound.\n\\item Idea is to have $FDR = \\mathbb{E}(FDP) \\leq \\alpha$.\n\\item The \\textbf{Benjamini-Hochberg Method} guarantees this asymptotically.\n\\end{itemize}\n```\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item Let $p_{(1)} < \\cdots < p_{(G)}$ be the ordered p-values. \n\\item Let $j$ index the ranks ($p_{(g)} = p_j$) and compute\n$$\nj^* = \\max \\left( j:p_j < \\frac {j \\alpha}G \\right)\n$$\n\\item Let $p^*=p_{j^*}$ be the rejection threshold. \n\\item Reject all null $H_{0j}$ where $p_j \\leq p^*$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n```\n\n\\textbf{If we apply the method, we can \\textbf{control} the FDR at $\\alpha$.}\n\n\\newpage\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrankedPValuesSub = sort( exp(-ScoresSub[,\"nlpvalueT\"]) )\nrankedPValuesAll = sort( exp(-ScoresAll[,\"nlpvalueT\"]) )\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2), pty = \"s\")\nplot( (1:10)/length(rankedPValuesSub), rankedPValuesSub[1:10],\n      xlab=\"Rank/NGenes\", ylab=\"p-value\")\nabline(0,.07)\nplot( (1:30)/length(rankedPValuesAll), rankedPValuesAll[1:30],\n      xlab=\"Rank/NGenes\", ylab=\"p-value\" )\nabline(0,.07)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Benjamini-Hochberg Plots](L10-fdr_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\nHow would you comment these results?\n:::\n\n\\newpage\n\n### Empirical Null Distribtution of Scores\n\nIt is simple to permute the labels of the subjects and recompute the scores. After permutation, for each gene, the link between expression and debulking has been broken. Discoveries are now random. We will look at a single permutation for illustration. As the number of features is large a single permutation can give reasonable indications. In a real application we may want to use multiple permutation and average over the inferential results, particularly if we are interested in events with small probability.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1)\nYYNull = YY[ sample(1:length(YY)) ]\nScoresSubNull = CompScores(XX,YYNull)\n\nset.seed(1)\nYYYNull = YYY[ sample(1:length(YYY)) ]\nScoresAllNull = CompScores(XXX,YYYNull)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nacut = .6\naucDiscAll = ScoresAll[,\"AUC\"]>acut\naucDiscAllNull = ScoresAllNull[,\"AUC\"]>acut\ntable(aucDiscAll)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\naucDiscAll\nFALSE  TRUE \n13076    28 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(aucDiscAllNull)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\naucDiscAllNull\nFALSE  TRUE \n13103     1 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n-   is it correct to conclude that of the 28 discovery, only 1 is likely false?\n\n-   what is 1/28 and estimate of?\n:::\n\n\\newpage\n\n### Empirical Bayes estimate of the false discovery rate:\n\nEmpirical Bayes FDR makes the 1/28 story a bit more formal. The thinking is now conditional on the observed set of data, specifically the observed set of scores, the $z$'s. The $z$'s can coincide with the p-values, but this logic does not require p-values, so the p-value calculation adds an unnecessary step.\n\nDefine $F(z) = P ( z_g \\leq z)$ to the the true marginal distribution of the scores, and $\\bar F(z) = 1 - F(z) = P ( z_g > z)$. Now restrict attention to the genes whose true generating model is null and let $\\bar F_0(z) = 1 - F_0(z) = P ( z_g > z | H_{og})$. In a genemo where $p_A$ genes are from some alternative (each gene can have its own!) and the remaining $1-p_A$ are from the same null, the unknown proportion of false discoveries can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{R_0}{R} = \\frac{ (1-p_A) * \\bar F_0 (z)}{(1-p_A) * \\bar F_0 (z) + p_A \\bar F_A (z) } =\\frac{  (1-p_A) \\bar F_0 (z)}{ \\bar F (z) } \\approx\\frac{ \\bar F_0 (z)}{ \\bar F (z) } \n$$\n\nIn EB, the denominator, for any given cutoff, can be estimated empirically from the geneome-wide distribution of $z_g$'s. Just don't pick the cutoff so that the list is empty.\n\nThe numerator is a bit trickier. If the disctribution of the $z$'s under the null is known (as is the case for example with $z$-scores for which normality can be trusted, $\\bar F_0 (z)$ can be estimated that way. If not, one approach is to use the geneome-wide distribution of $z_g$'s after a permutation that mimics the global null. $p_A$ is not identifiable w/out parametric / smoothness assumptions on the distributions of the $z$'s. A surprisingly useful approximation is $1-p_A = 1$, which gives a conservative bounds to EF FDR, but often a reasonably realistic one.\n\n[\\@Efron2003as](https://doi.org/10.1214/aos/1051027871)\n\n::: callout-note\n-   tie this back to the 1/28 story\n:::\n\n\\newpage\n\n### Empirical Bayes estimate of the local FDR\n\nLet's look at estimates of densities corresponding to $F$ and $F_0$.
